# Image-Colorization
A Deep Learning project for image colorization using convolutional autoencoders and generative adversarial networks

Image colorization is an emerging topic and a fascinating area of research in recent years. In this paper, we
implemented deep learning algorithms to colorize black and white images. Convolutional autoencoder neural network
and generative adversarial network (GAN) have been implemented on black and white images. The networks aim to
convert the black and white images to their respective color format. The color format used for the implementation of the
networks is RGB color space. The performance of the autoencoder model is evaluated using root means squared error,
means squared error, means absolute error and colorization accuracy. The data used for the implementation of the
networks consists of 7000 images in the RGB color space. The performance of the implemented autoencoder models and
generative adversarial network is measured using mean absolute error. The colorization performance of the generative
adversarial network is better that that of the autoencoder models.
